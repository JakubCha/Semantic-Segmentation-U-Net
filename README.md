# Semantic-Segmentation-U-Net

This is my implementation of Semantic Segmentation based on the U-Net Architecture (Ref - https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) for the ISPRS Dataset. I am not allowed to make the ISPRS dataset publically available but you can use any other Dataset (PASCAL VOC etc) on this code, after a little tweaking.

To run the code, change the directory argument at the end of the "UNet_ISPRS.py" file to the directory containing your data. The directory structure has been explained the code. Please adhere to the same.

I have explained pretty much every function and will keep updating the code to make it more readable every week.
